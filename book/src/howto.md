## How to Use This Book

Each puzzle follows a consistent format designed to progressively build your skills:

- **Overview**: Clear problem statement and key concepts introduced in each puzzle
- **Configuration**: Setup parameters and memory organization specific to each challenge
- **Code to Complete**: Skeleton code with specific sections for you to implement
- **Tips**: Optional hints if you get stuck, without giving away complete solutions
- **Solution**: Detailed explanations of the implementation, performance considerations, and underlying concepts

The puzzles gradually increase in complexity, introducing new concepts while reinforcing fundamentals. We recommend solving them in order, as later puzzles build on skills developed in earlier ones.

## Running the code

All puzzles are designed to be run with the provided testing framework that verifies your implementation against expected results. Each puzzle includes instructions for running the code and validating your solution.

## Prerequisites

### Compatible GPU

You'll need a [compatible GPU](https://docs.modular.com/max/faq#gpu-requirements) to run the examples.

### Setting up your environment

[Clone the GitHub repository](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles) and make sure you have the `magic` CLI installed to be able to run the Mojo programs:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles
cd mojo-gpu-puzzles

# Install magic CLI (if not already installed)
curl -ssL https://magic.modular.com/ | bash

# Or update if already installed
magic self-update
```

### Knowledge prerequisites

Basic knowledge of:

- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Parallel computing concepts (threads, synchronization, race conditions)
- Basic familiarity with [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/) (language basics parts and [intro to pointers](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/pointers/) section)
- [A tour of GPU basics in Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/basics) is helpful

No prior GPU programming experience is necessary! We'll build that knowledge through the puzzles.

Let's begin our journey into the exciting world of GPU computing with Mojo ðŸ”¥!
