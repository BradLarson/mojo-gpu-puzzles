## About This Book

This book contains a series of puzzles designed to teach GPU programming concepts using Mojo.
Each puzzle focuses on a specific concept and provides a hands-on opportunity to implement
GPU kernels.

The puzzles progress from basic concepts to more advanced topics:

1. Simple mapping operations
2. Multi-dimensional data handling
3. Shared memory usage
4. Advanced algorithms like convolution and prefix sums
5. Matrix operations

## How to Use This Book

For each puzzle:
1. Read the problem description and understand the task
2. Implement the missing code in the corresponding file in the `problems/` directory
3. Run the code using `magic run <problem_file>`
4. Check your output against the expected output

Let's get started with the first puzzle!
